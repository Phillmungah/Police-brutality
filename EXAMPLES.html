        <h1> Examples of countries affected by police brutality</h1>
    
    <p>People's Republic of China[edit] Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Within the past decade, groups such as Falun Gong have protested party measures and been broken up by riot police. Chinese dissidents have been able to arrange effective mobilization through use of social media and informal communication like Twitter and its Chinese counterparts Weibo or microblogs.[8]</p>

<p>Foreign journalists from Switzerland have reported cases of police harassment. Media suppression has increased in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia. Plainclothes policemen are often deployed during demonstrations to suppress violence. Censorship is often maintained as a measure to maintain political stability in China. Web activists can be charged by the police for using false identities to surf the Internet. After arrests, homes of the arrested individual are often searched for incriminating evidence such as computers, hard drives, and flash drives.[9]</p>

<p>Russia[edit] Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of Vladimir Putin in 2012. Attention has been given to incidence of violence via posting videos online. President Dmitry Medvedev has initiated reforms of the police force, in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralizing police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give due process to citizens. Proper investigations of police officials still remains lacking by western standards.[10]</p>

<p>In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract false confessions from detainees. Police regulations require quotas of officers for solved crimes, a practice that encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.[11]</p>

<p>Finland[edit] Historically, anti-communist police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s - in the wake of the Finnish Civil War. Some local sections of the secret police (Etsiv&auml; Keskuspoliisi) routinely beat up arrested communists.</p>

<p>As of 2006, there were 7700 police officers in Finland.[12] That police force was shown to be more law-abiding than firemen.[12] However, it was revealed there are a few dozen cases each year in which police officers are convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of such crimes prosecuted annually - the number of such crimes being shown to increase yearly.[12] These cases concerned most frequently vehicular collisions while in pursuit and the excessive use of force.[12]</p>

<p>In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable attracted a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence.[13] In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over the body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken and the victim was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence.[14][15] In 2010, two police officers assaulted a man in a wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur.[16] In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stamping on a man&rsquo;s head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of Romani descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present.[17][18]</p>

<p>Indonesia[edit] Islamic extremists in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists who attempt to uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine Tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed Suharto regime (1967&ndash;1998), from which Suharto seized power during an anti-Communist purge.[19]</p>

<p>Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments light and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. Amnesty International has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing, to ensure that they meet international standards.[20]</p>

<p>Bangladesh[edit] [icon] This section requires expansion. (February 2016) A lot of people have been viciously beaten by police in Bangladesh. Various protesters were beaten with bats and sticks while protesting to insult of Islam.[21]</p>

<p>Canada[edit] Main article: List of cases of police brutality in Canada There have been a number of high-profile cases of alleged police brutality, including 2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests,[22] the 2012 Quebec student protests,[23] the Robert Dzieka&#324;ski Taser incident, and the shooting of Sammy Yatim. The recent public incidents in which police judgments or actions have been called into question have raised fundamental concerns about police accountability and governance.[24]</p>

<p>On March 16, 2014, 300 people were arrested in Montreal during a protest against police brutality.[25]</p>

<p>Turkey[edit]</p>

<p>A protester shows his wounded eye. Police brutality was one of the main issues arising from the 2013 protests in Turkey. Turkey has a history of police brutality, including (particularly between 1977 and 2002) the use of torture. Police brutality featuring excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protestors with tear gas canisters),[26] pepper spray and water cannon as well as physical violence against protestors has been seen, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and May Day demonstrations. The 2013 protests in Turkey were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of Taksim Gezi Park.</p>

<p>In 2012 a number of officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of political activist Engin &Ccedil;eber.</p>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.[27]</p>

<p>Middle East[edit] See also: August 2013 Rabaa massacre Police brutality was a major drive behind 2011 Egyptian revolution;[28] the incident of Khaled Said's death and other stories, yet very little has changed since. One of the &quot;demands&quot; around which people decided to take it to the streets in Egypt is &quot;purging the Ministry of Interior&quot; for its brutality and torture practices. Things are said[by whom?] to have gone wrong following the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi. Police are said to have used brutal force again while dispersing a pro-Morsi sit-in near the Rabaa al-Adawiya square, with the official death toll at over 800,[29] in what is said to be one of the most brutal uses of force against civilians in Egypt's modern history.[30]</p>

<p> Police arrest a man during the Watts Riots, August 1965 The GCC states have seen many cases of brutality, some even involving senior figures. For example, Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan a UAE sheikh, was involved in the torture of many business associates and he often recorded some of the abuse. Sheikh Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him.[31] Amnesty International has also reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation.[32] Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.[33]</p>

<p>United States[edit] Main article: Police brutality in the United States In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s, anti-war demonstrations, the War on Drugs, and the Global War on Terrorism. In 2014, the UN Committee against Torture condemned police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement in the US, and highlighted the &quot;frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals.&quot;[34]</p>

<p>Few members of the United States military police were responsible for the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in Iraq and were sentenced to varying prison terms back in the US.</p>

<p>Hong Kong[edit] During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, there have been numerous instances of police brutality. Seven police officers have been caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed.[35] There have also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. Pictures on local TV and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers' views are blocked, and in some cases re-emerging with visible injuries.[36]</p>
