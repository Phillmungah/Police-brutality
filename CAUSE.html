        <h1>Causes of police brutality</h1>
        <p>Causes[edit]</p>

<p>Protest against police brutality after the eviction of unemployed demonstrators occupying the Post Office in Vancouver, Canada, 1938 Police officers are legally permitted to use force, and their superiors &mdash; and the public &mdash; expect them to do so. According to Jerome Herbert Skolnick, in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.[37]</p>

<p>There are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that some personality traits make some officers more susceptible to the use of excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists were surveyed on officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. These include personality disorders, previous traumatic job-related experience, young inexperienced or macho officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles, and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorizes groups of officers, separating the group that most likely use excessive force.[38] However, this &quot;bad apple paradigm&quot; is considered by some to be an &quot;easy way out&quot;. A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it &quot;a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults &ndash; behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors.&quot;[39] The report goes on to discuss the systemic factors, which include:</p>

<p>Pressures to conform to certain aspects of &quot;police culture&quot;, such as the Blue Code of Silence, which can &quot;sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law&quot;[40] and a &quot;'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust&quot;[39] Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation (&quot;results indicate that the more rigid the hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making&quot; concludes one study reviewed in the report);[41] and Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).[39] Police use of force is kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a use of force continuum.[42] A use of force continuum sets levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a subject's behavior. This power is granted by the civil government, with limits set out in statutory law as well as common law.</p>

<p>Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Indeed, &quot;police brutality&quot; is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).</p>

<p>Studies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as &quot;vigilantism&quot;, where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.[43]</p>

<p>During high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can effect their judgment when they finally apprehend the suspect. The resulting loss of judgment and heighten emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force. The effect is colloquially known as &quot;high-speed pursuit syndrome.&quot;[44]</p>
